Hi! Iâ€™m Dave, a PhD (<a href="https://uni-of-oxford.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/185/~/what-is-a-dphil" target="_blank">DPhil</a>) student at the University of Oxford, UK in the Department of Astrophysics. I specialise in optical instrumentation for astronomy, and also get to do some science with observational data. In my career so far I've built telescopes for imaging the earth from space, and now I'm helping to build an instrument for imaging space from earth using the world's largest optical telescope, the <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/elt/" target="_blank">Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)</a>.

I'm also a freelance consultant in the NewSpace industry. I help start-ups with their technical concepts, grant writing, and business strategy. Although specialising in optical and photonics systems, I also have experience with broader satellite systems, mission concepts, and business development.

Finally, I contribute to <a href="https://astrobites.org/" target="_blank">Astrobites</a>, a "daily astrophysical literature journal written by graduate students in astronomy". It's aimed at undergraduates who want a more accessible view on recent publications.
