Hi! Iâ€™m Dave, a PhD (DPhil) student at the University of Oxford, UK in the Department of Astrophysics. I specialise in optical instrumentation for astronomy, and also get to do some science with observational data. In my career so far I've built telescopes for imaging the earth from space, and now I'm building an instrument for imaging space from earth using the world's largest optical telescope, the [Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/elt/).
