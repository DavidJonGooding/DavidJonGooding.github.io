At ESA I was on the Young Graduate Trainee program, which is a one year work placement for recent graduates. I was involved in the following:

• Payload technology validation activities on infrared detectors for future astronomy missions
• Characterised Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) infrared (IR) prototype detectors
• Presented a paper at the SPIE Astronomical Telescopes & Instrumentation conference 2016
