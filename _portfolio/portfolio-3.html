At the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory I was an industrial placement student for 6 months during my undergraduate degree. I was involved in the performance testing and redesign of mm-wave components for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope.

Specifically I was able to work on the local oscillator on Band 5, and was even able to contribute to a large meeting in Chile and visit the site of the telescope in the Atacama desert during construction in 2011.
